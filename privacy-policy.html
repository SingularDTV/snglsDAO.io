          Based on your consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR).<br/>
          If you have given us consent to process personal data for specific purposes, the lawfulness of this processing is based on your consent.

        <li>
          Due to legal requirements (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR) or in the public interest (Article 6 (1) (e) GDPR).<br/>

      </p>

      <h2>5. IS DATA TRANSMITTED TO A THIRD COUNTRY OR TO AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION?</h2>
      <p>A transfer of data to offices in the countries outside the European Union (so-called “third countries”) takes place when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>it is necessary to execute your orders (e.g. payment orders, billing of credit card payments);</li>
        <li>it is necessary to fulfill our legal and contractual obligations towards you;</li>

      </p>
      <p>
        The use of third country service providers can be authorized if they provide additional written instructions on how they will comply with the level of data protection in Europe and ensure the adequate level of protection by applying one of the following measures:

      <p>
        <em>If the data is no longer required for the fulfillment of contractual or legal obligations, it will be regularly deleted, unless temporary further processing of that data is necessary for the following purposes:

        Each data subject has the right to information under Article 15 of the GDPR, the right of correction under Article 16 GDPR, the right to cancellation under Article 17 GDPR, the right to restriction of processing under Article 18 GDPR, the right to object under Article 21 GDPR and the right to data portability under Article 20 GDPR. In addition, there is the right of appeal to a competent data protection supervisory authority (Article 77 GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may revoke your consent to the processing of personal data at any time. This also applies to the revocation of declarations of consent that were issued to us or our predecessors prior to the validity of the Basic Data Protection Regulation, i.e. before May 25, 2018. Please note that the revocation only works for the future; processing that took place before the revocation is not affected.
      </p>
      <h2>8. IS THERE A DUTY FOR ME TO PROVIDE DATA?</h2>
      <p>As part of our business relationship, you must provide the personal information necessary to enter into a business relationship and perform its contractual obligations, or we are required to collect it by law. Without this information, we will generally not be able to enter into contractual relationship or provide you with our services.
      </p>
      <p>In particular, according to the money laundering regulations, we may be obliged to identify you prior to the establishment of a business relationship on the basis of your identity document and to record the name, place of birth, date of birth, nationality, address and identity card details. In order for us to be able to fulfill this legal obligation, you must provide us with the necessary information and documents in accordance with the Anti Money Laundering Act and immediately notify  us of any changes that occur during the business relationship. If you do not provide us with the necessary information and documents, we may not start or continue a potential business relationship with you.
      </p>
      <h2>9. TO WHAT EXTENT IS THERE AN AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING PROCESS?</h2>
      <p>To establish and conduct the business relationship, we may use automated decision-making processes in accordance with Article 22 GDPR. If required by law, we inform the customer in such a case, taking into account the provisions of Article 13 paragraph 2 lit. f GDPR specifically about this and its rights under Article 22 (3) GDPR.
      </p>
      <p>Further information can be found in section 10 of this privacy policy.
      </p>
      <h2>10. IS PROFILING TAKING PLACE?</h2>
      <p>We sometimes process your data automatically with the aim of evaluating certain personal aspects (so-called profiling). For example, we use profiling in the following cases:
      </p>
      <p>Due to legal and regulatory requirements, we are committed to combating money laundering, the financing of terrorism and property-related offenses. Data evaluations may be carried out to provide you with targeted information and advice on products.  To this end, we may use evaluation tools that enable needs-based communication and advertising, including market and opinion research.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-center">INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR RIGHT OF OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21 GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR)</h2>
      <h3>1. Case-specific right of objection</h3>
      <p>Pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. e GDPR (Data Processing in the Public Interest) and Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR (data processing on the basis of a balance of interests) you have the right, at any time during your relationship with us, to prevent the processing of your personal data and profiling, as that term is defined under Article 4(4) GDPR. If you object, we will no longer process your personal information or engage in profiling unless we can establish, in accordance with GDPR     guidelines, compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or that the processing is for the purposes of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Right to object to the processing of data for direct marketing purposes</h3>
      <p>In individual cases, we process your personal data in order to operate direct mail. You have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purposes of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct mail. If you object to such processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process your personal data for these purposes.
      </p>
      <p><em>The objection should be in writing and should be directed to:</em><br>

        <li>"Session Cookies" log a sequence of web pages on our website snglsdao.io that a user has visited. These Cookies are not permanently stored and are used to serve a website, for example, by allowing a user to switch from one web page to another without having to re-register. Closing the Internet browser deletes all Session Cookies on your computer.</li>
        <li>"Persistent Cookies" are Cookies which remain on your device even after the Internet browser has been closed, until a specified expiration date. Persistent Cookies are always activated when you visit the website that created the Cookie.</li>
        <li>"Flash Cookies" are in general not used on our website.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>THIS WEBSITE USES COOKIES IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>First-party cookies are used to legitimize the user for the Session Cookies, which are technically required for the functionality of our website or to fulfill a service or option requested by you</li>
        <li>Persistent cookies that recognize the customer on a web page visit within and/ or between sessions, that remember previously selected options, product features such as credit card type, and/or additional services available (for online customer service users only), or</li>
        <li>To additionally secure access for online customer service and online application.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>WEB ANALYSIS OF THE WEBSITE</h2>

      <h2>WHICH SOCIAL MEDIA SERVICE DO WE USE?</h2>
      <p><em>Integration of services and contents of third parties</em></p>
      <p>It may happen that content from third parties, such as videos from YouTube or Facebook, maps from Google Maps, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites are included on the snglsDAO website.  This always presupposes that the providers of this content (hereinafter referred to as "third party provider") perceive the IP address of the users in order to send the content to the browser of each user. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content. We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. However, we do not have any influence on whether the third parties provide the IP address.  If we learn additional information about the policies of the third party providers, we will inform the users.
